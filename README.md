## Overview

This repo is using Python Interactive window / Jupytext for notebooks with random datageneration for exploration and fun. ðŸŽ¨

***Disclaimer:** The data might be super biased and does not represent real distributions.*

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- VSCode Python Interactive Window (Jupytext?)
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

The code is used for exploration of data generation techniques and visualization. If the code is viewed in VSCode, Python Interactive Window should be enabled by default and one can run each part of the code as different cells. These parts could be copied to other projects if one desires.

## Versioning

Previous versions included Jupyter Notebooks, but for git versioning and diff readability the code is now in Python files with `#%%` marking different cells.
